# Brainfuck2-encrypt
Encrypts and outputs your string as Brainfuck2 code.

Now you can send secret spy messages with your geek friends... [**IN BRAINFUCK 2!!!**](https://github.com/notmax6677/Brainfuck2)

## Building

Just download the repo with `git clone https://github.com/notmax6677/Brainfuck2-encrypt`, then run `go build`, assuming you have Golang installed on your machine.

## How to use

Once you have built the encryption tool, you can encrypt a piece of text into Brainfuck2 code by executing:
`bf2-encrypt [your text]`

For example;
`bf2-encrypt i have no life`

This will create an `output.bf2` file, which will have Brainfuck2 code that directly outputs `i have no life` if you run it.

Have fun lol
